# Wrangle and Analyze Data by Abdullah Muhammed

_Data Analyst nanodegree - Udacity_

# Introduction

This project focused on wrangling data from the WeRateDogs Twitter account using Python, documented in a Jupyter Notebook (wrangle_act.ipynb). This Twitter account rates dogs with humorous commentary. The rating denominator is usually 10, however, the numerators are usually greater than 10.
wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.

# Project Details

Fully assessing and cleaning the entire dataset would require exceptional effort so only a subset of its issues (eight quality issues and two tidiness issues at minimum) needed to be assessed and cleaned.

The tasks for this project were:

* Data wrangling, which consists of:
  * Gathering data
  * Assessing data
  * Cleaning data
* Storing, analyzing, and visualizing our wrangled data
* Reporting on 1) our data wrangling efforts and 2) our data analyses and visualizations

## Installing

* Install Jupyter Notebook to run `wrangle_act.ipynb`.
* Need consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_secret to query from Twitter API.
* Require the following libraries installed.

* numpy
* pandas
* requests
* json
* matplotlib.pyplot

## Files

* `act_report`: Communicates the insights and displays the Visualizations produced from the wrangled data.
* `./Data/image_prediction.tsv`: Data downloaded using Requests library and URL.
* `tweet_json.txt`: Data gathered from twitter API.
* `./Data/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv`: File downloaded from Udacity.
* `./Data/twitter_archive_master.csv`: The clean DataFrame 1.
* `./Data/twitter_image_predictions.csv`: The clean DataFrame 2.
* `wrangle_act.ipynb`: The main file containing all the gathering, wrangling and analyzing work.
* `wrangle_report`: Briefly describes my wrangling efforts.
